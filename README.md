### GetData - Course Project

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, clean and manipulate a complex dataset. Version 1 of the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (HAR)** was obtained from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository (UCI)** and utilized as the raw data.

In addition to this Readme.md, this repository contains:  
1. **run_analysis.R** - R script which takes the compressed UCI HAR dataset as input and outputs a tidy data table according to project guidelines (see Code Book for more details). My implementation makes use of the [plyr package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plyr/index.html) which may need to be installed. 
2. **CodeBook.md** - Code book containing information about the measurements, data and transformations  

**Note**: This repository does not contain the compressed UCI HAR Dataset zip file which can be obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) (59.7 Mb)
